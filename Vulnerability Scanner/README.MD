# Vulnerability Scanner

## Description

This project is a **Python-based vulnerability scanner** developed to identify **potentially vulnerable services** running on a target system. The scanner works by performing **TCP port scanning**, **banner grabbing**, and **matching service banners** against a database of known vulnerable banners.

The project is designed for **educational and learning purposes** and demonstrates fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as socket programming, multithreading, banner grabbing, and basic vulnerability detection techniques.

## Key Features

- TCP-based port scanning  
- Banner grabbing from open services  
- Detection of known vulnerable services using banner matching  
- Multithreaded scanning for improved performance  
- Supports IP addresses and domain names  
- Console-based output with no data modification  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- `socket`  
- `IPy`  
- `threading`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- IPy library  

To install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install IPy
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/projects.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd projects
Verify Python installation:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Usage
Run the vulnerability scanner from the command line:

bash
Copy code
python3 portsc.py
You will be prompted to enter:

Target IP address or domain name

Number of ports to scan

Example:

text
Copy code
Enter Target IP address, localhost or www.domainname.com : 192.168.1.10
Enter Number of ports to be scanned: 1000
Output
If a vulnerable service is detected, the scanner prints:

text
Copy code
[!] Vulneribility found: vsFTPd 2.3.4 at port 21
If no vulnerable banners are found, no output is displayed.

Working Explanation
The user provides a target IP address or domain name.

The user specifies the number of ports to scan.

The scanner creates multiple threads to scan ports concurrently.

Each thread attempts a TCP connection to a specific port.

If the connection is successful, the service banner is retrieved.

Open ports and their banners are stored in memory.

The collected banners are compared with known vulnerable banners stored in a text file.

If a match is found, the service is reported as potentially vulnerable.

Limitations
Uses banner-based vulnerability detection only

No CVE or exploit database integration

Does not perform active exploitation

No operating system fingerprinting

No persistent storage of scan results

Future Enhancements
Integrate CVE-based vulnerability detection

Add port range selection

Improve error handling and reporting

Save scan results to a file

Enhance banner database management
