# Vulnerability Scanner

## Description

This project is a **Python-based vulnerability scanner** developed to identify **potentially vulnerable services** running on a target system. The scanner works by performing **TCP port scanning**, **banner grabbing**, and **matching service banners** against a database of known vulnerable banners.

The project is designed for **educational and learning purposes** and demonstrates fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as socket programming, multithreading, banner grabbing, and basic vulnerability detection techniques.

---

## Key Features

- TCP-based port scanning  
- Banner grabbing from open services  
- Detection of known vulnerable services using banner matching  
- Multithreaded scanning for improved performance  
- Supports IP addresses and domain names  
- Console-based output with no data modification  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- `socket`  
- `IPy`  
- `threading`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- IPy library  

To install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install IPy
````

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/projects.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd projects
```

Verify Python installation:

```bash
python --version
```

---

## Usage

Run the vulnerability scanner from the command line:

```bash
python3 portsc.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

1. Target IP address or domain name
2. Number of ports to scan

Example:

```text
Enter Target IP address, localhost or www.domainname.com : 192.168.1.10
Enter Number of ports to be scanned: 1000
```

---

## Output

If a vulnerable service is detected, the scanner prints:

```text
[!] Vulneribility found: vsFTPd 2.3.4 at port 21
```

If no vulnerable banners are found, no output is displayed.

---

## Working Explanation

1. The user provides a target IP address or domain name.
2. The user specifies the number of ports to scan.
3. The scanner creates multiple threads to scan ports concurrently.
4. Each thread attempts a TCP connection to a specific port.
5. If the connection is successful, the service banner is retrieved.
6. Open ports and their banners are stored in memory.
7. The collected banners are compared with known vulnerable banners stored in a text file.
8. If a match is found, the service is reported as potentially vulnerable.

---

## Limitations

* Uses banner-based vulnerability detection only
* No CVE or exploit database integration
* Does not perform active exploitation
* No operating system fingerprinting
* No persistent storage of scan results

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate CVE-based vulnerability detection
* Add port range selection
* Improve error handling and reporting
* Save scan results to a file
* Enhance banner database management
